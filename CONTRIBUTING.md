## üé® Coding Standards

### Shell Script Standards
- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang for bash scripts
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env zsh` for zsh scripts
- Follow [Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Framework Standards
- All functions must be prefixed with `show_gui_` for GUI components
- Use the universal color variables (`C_RED`, `C_GREEN`, etc.)
- Include TTY detection for interactive components
- Support 'q' quit functionality in all interactive components
- Use English for all user-facing text

### Example Function Template
```bash
show_gui_new_component() {
    require_tty
    local title="$1"
    local subtitle="$2"
    
    echo -e "${C_BLUE}üìã $title${C_NC}"
    echo -e "${C_GRAY}$subtitle${C_NC}"
    echo -e "${C_GRAY}‚Üê‚Üí toggle ‚Ä¢ enter submit ‚Ä¢ q Quit${C_NC}"
    
    # Your component logic here
    
    # Handle quit functionality
    if [[ -z "$result" ]]; then
        handle_quit "Component cancelled by user"
    fi
    
    echo "$result"
